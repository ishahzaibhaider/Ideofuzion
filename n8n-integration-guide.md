# n8n Integration Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully integrated n8n credential creation into your signup process. Here's what was added:

### 1. n8n Service (`server/n8nService.ts`)
- **Main Function**: `createN8nCredential(user)` - Creates n8n credentials for new users
- **Configuration**: Uses your API key and server endpoint (n8n.hireninja.site)
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles failures without breaking user registration
- **Extensible**: Includes examples for different credential types (database, API, etc.)

### 2. Integration Points
- **Regular Signup**: Added to `/api/auth/register` endpoint in `server/routes.ts`
- **Google OAuth**: Added to Google OAuth callback in `server/routes.ts`
- **Compiled Version**: Also integrated into `index.js` for the compiled version

### 3. How It Works
When a user signs up (either via form or Google OAuth):
1. User account is created in your MongoDB
2. n8n credential is automatically created using the n8n API
3. If n8n credential creation fails, it logs the error but doesn't break signup
4. User gets their JWT token and can proceed normally

## Current Configuration

### Default Credential Type
Currently set to create `httpBasicAuth` credentials with:
- **Name**: "{User Name} - User Credential"
- **Type**: httpBasicAuth
- **Data**: User email and default password

### Customization Options

You can easily modify the `createN8nCredential` function in `server/n8nService.ts` to:

1. **Change credential type**:
   ```typescript
   type: "httpHeaderAuth", // or "oauth2Api", "postgres", etc.
   ```

2. **Add custom data**:
   ```typescript
   data: {
     apiKey: generateApiKeyForUser(user),
     endpoint: "your-api-endpoint"
   }
   ```

3. **Create multiple credentials per user**:
   ```typescript
   await createDatabaseCredential(user);
   await createAPICredential(user, apiKey);
   ```

## Testing the Integration

To test if the integration works:

1. **Sign up a new user** through your app
2. **Check n8n interface** at https://n8n.hireninja.site
3. **Look for credentials** - You should see new credentials created with the user's name

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ API key is stored server-side only
- ‚úÖ Error handling prevents signup failures
- ‚úÖ Uses HTTPS headers for n8n API calls
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider rotating API keys periodically
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You may want to store n8n credential IDs in your database for future reference

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Customize credential types** based on your workflow needs
2. **Add credential management** (update/delete when users are modified)
3. **Store n8n credential IDs** in your user database for reference
4. **Add webhooks** to sync changes between your app and n8n

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `server/n8nService.ts` (new file)
- ‚úÖ `server/routes.ts` (added n8n integration)
- ‚úÖ `index.js` (added n8n integration to compiled version)
- ‚úÖ `package.json` (added axios dependency)

Your n8n integration is now live and ready! üöÄ
